### Hi there 👋

I'm a Infrastructure Engineer at [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) helping build their hosting platform Ghost(Pro) 👻

I built [GeoJS](https://geojs.io/) a geo-location 🌏 lookup API serving 120 million requests daily.

You can find my blog [over here](https://jloh.co) and I'm also on [Twitter](https://jloh.co/l/twitter) 🦉
